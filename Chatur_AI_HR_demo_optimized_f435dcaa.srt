1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,260
It's an AI powered recruiting assistant to streamline the hiring process with intelligent automation and data driven insights.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,530
So let's start from a quick question.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,470
Hey, what you can do?

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:42,770
Oh, it can help us in creating JDs, screening candidates, sending emails, developing assessments and went like into a show during and off.

5
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,930
So let's start by creating a new JD.

6
00:00:44,930 --> 00:01:07,570
So he's asking about some details.

7
00:02:36,060 --> 00:03:36,310
So I guess we got some incident credits.

8
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,280
I'll do a quick recharge.

9
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,970
So I have zero credits.

10
00:03:51,470 --> 00:04:11,550
I'll try to buy some credits.

11
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,930
Yes, so I think my credits are updated.

12
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,170
If I don't crash.

13
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,130
Yeah.

14
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,170
So the guy can start.

15
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,410
Yeah.

16
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,090
So I think the JD mission has been started.

17
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,520
We'll take a little time because like there is a process of generation that is happening here.

18
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,580
Yes, we got it.

19
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:37,940
Yeah.

20
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:48,330
So as you can see all the details, whether it's a liberal department, experience girls qualifications, pretty much a very good JD.

21
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
Also, if I want, I can modify something.

22
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,490
But we'll skip it.

23
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,450
So we can publish this JD also.

24
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,530
It will be published to the characters career pages.

25
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,750
So that anyone can comment apply.

26
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,900
Now let me proceed with the screening candidates for this journey as they have created and published the journey.

27
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,640
The candidates will apply and now we can screen the candidates.

28
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,300
I should continue.

29
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,470
Now I need to approach as much as you are.

30
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,220
We can approach as many as we want.

31
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:09,740
Just I'm uploading less because we need to be quickly.

32
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,220
So the AI is analyzing the candidates.

33
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,820
It will take a little time.

34
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,260
So we got the scores for the software engineer.

35
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,560
We can click and see what the profile experience.

36
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:46,120
We can get an insight of that particular whether it was a personal type of match for experience for educational background for projects.

37
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,210
And then a summary of the entire resume.

38
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,780
Like that's a very detailed analysis of the resume we can see over here.

39
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:14,000
We also have some filters to like adjust and see how the resume can apply and rescreen on the basis of these fields.

40
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,620
Like what's awaited what what is awaited if we want to get to any of these keys.

41
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,720
So let's subtraction.

42
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,530
Now reject for them.

43
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,400
Select selected.

44
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,810
Select selected.

45
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,870
So the rejected candidates will get a rejection.

46
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,600
We can continue the next process.

47
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:38,360
So after the screen of candidates we can start with assessments or we can directly conduct a review if you want.

48
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,420
I'll start with assessments.

49
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,670
So we can create different types of resume whether it's cognitive or scale or task.

50
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,650
We can like create any of these three or we can create all of these three whatever we want.

51
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,770
And we can conduct that in a sequential manner.

52
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,970
So let's start with cognitive assessment.

53
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,320
I'll select TV level for take time.

54
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,460
I will select that.

55
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,020
The resume will be 10 questions.

56
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,580
I said 10.

57
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,900
Just to be quick.

58
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,620
So we've got some cognitive questions of verbal and RC if that's passage.

59
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,760
Then we have a question for passage.

60
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,240
Okay.

61
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,400
And that's an RC or big RC.

62
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,200
Then we have the logical reasoning questions.

63
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,980
The critical reasoning question abstract and all.

64
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,940
We have enough standard cognitive assessment.

65
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,420
Yeah.

66
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,820
So this minute I've been catered.

67
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,640
Now I can send this into the candidates that I have accepted like after the screening.

68
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
So let's send this assessment.

69
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,830
So it's asking which assessment I want to send as after cognitive as an assessment.

70
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,320
The email I can send to the shortest candidates.

71
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,840
I think that could have accepted.

72
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,740
I like to see if the same.

73
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,160
Okay.

74
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,370
So yeah.

75
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,580
What an email with the different details, position, time, duration.

76
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,100
And then I can send this one from here.

77
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,640
Right.

78
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,820
But don't be once in a while.

79
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,300
I think that was a visual with my.

80
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, basically.

81
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,810
Let's start with this one.

82
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,800
So we have a question.

83
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,960
This is the passage.

84
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,280
Then I have a question.

85
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,400
Select this.

86
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,630
Select some random options.

87
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,240
Let's see how much I score.

88
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,650
To mission the living.

89
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,130
I guess.

90
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,520
I see my questions.

91
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,420
Well, so much for this one.

92
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,020
So first thing.

93
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,340
So this one has been conducted now as the husband is completed.

94
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,230
I can now shortlist the candidates for whatever the next one that I want to conduct.

95
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,830
So I want to open it next time within the skill assessment.

96
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,050
So I will proceed with shortlisting for the skill assessment.

97
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,920
So like the flow is very simple.

98
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,200
Like supposedly conducted an assessment.

99
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,480
Now we have to you, you would choose like what should be our next round.

100
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,000
It could be another assessment on what it would be an interview round.

101
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,800
So I'll just take start with one more assessment.

102
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,040
Or I think I should shortlist first.

103
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,220
So I'll just turn once the red line is passes.

104
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,040
You can proceed with shortlisting candidates for the next one.

105
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,560
The red line is passed.

106
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,700
I'll shortlist the candidates for next.

107
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,030
So I try to asking you which round you want to generate a shortlisting report.

108
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,410
So I would say now that I want to conduct an assessment round.

109
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,690
So I will generate that.

110
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,330
So it's generating the report of the failure assessment that I have conducted,

111
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,550
which was cooperative assessment.

112
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,780
Yeah, so we could have scored only 10%.

113
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,640
So here we can see the statistics of the candidates.

114
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,000
I would score the highest for the lowest four.

115
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,800
Also the scores for individual candidates too.

116
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,840
In the business of this, we can decide like what should be our shortlisting criteria.

117
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,300
It could be either a score based or it could be a count based.

118
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,920
Suppose I want to sort list of one candidate to get at that.

119
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,960
So if I want to sort list candidates have scored our specific percentage.

120
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,900
If I say suppose it's 20 between the 10 of days,

121
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,680
suppose it's 98.

122
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,400
It could be either of these two.

123
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,300
I would say it's a shortlist top one.

124
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,050
So the candidates would be shortlisted in the next round.

125
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,330
So this was the cognitive report.

126
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,570
Now, yeah, one candidate has been successfully listed.

127
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,310
Now I can create a skill assessment and send it to the shortlisted candidate

128
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,430
for a skill assessment round.

129
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,410
Very simple.

130
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,990
I think complicated.

131
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:37,760
So we can create a skill assessment now.

132
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,650
I will do it easy to look back.

133
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,310
Now I can come to that skills.

134
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,670
I can add these skills for this job description that I have of AI engineer.

135
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,480
That should be software engineer.

136
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,780
The assessment is being generated.

137
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,940
So for the skill assessment, what we do for each skill,

138
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,100
we scrape the web.

139
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,240
We get some points for that particular.

140
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,380
So suppose I'm generating a question for Python,

141
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,400
then it will skip the web at some better context of the Python.

142
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,160
It could be questions.

143
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,080
It could be some theory or practice problems.

144
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,940
And it will generate questions on the basis of that.

145
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,670
So like very good quality questions we would get here.

146
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,760
Yeah.

147
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,200
So this was medium level assessment.

148
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
Now I can proceed with.

149
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,010
So it is saying, let me know if you want to send the assessment email.

150
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,350
Yeah, I want to send the assessment email to the candidates.

151
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
I have shortlisted the candidates before.

152
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,640
So the assessment will be sent to those candidates

153
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,340
who have shortlisted for the skill assessment.

154
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,940
Yeah.

155
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,180
So I was asking whether it's a skill or not.

156
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,820
It's a skill.

157
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,300
So yeah.

158
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,340
I've been sent to the shortlisted candidates.

159
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,780
They will receive the link, I guess.

160
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,360
So I got the assessment.

161
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,260
But I'll start at same.

162
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,820
Like I did the common investment.

163
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,360
I can do the skill assessment too.

164
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,640
Login.

165
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,650
Keeping.

166
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:23,950
Star.

167
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,210
This one is submitted.

168
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,620
So now.

169
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,630
So now I can decide what should be my next round.

170
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,450
It could be either task placement that we have over here

171
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,570
or it could be an interview round.

172
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,560
I'll proceed with task.
